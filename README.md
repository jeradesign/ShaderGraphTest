# ShaderGraphTest
This is the code John Brewer wrote at the 8/13/2025 Vision Pro Developers Meetup.

Note that this is built under Xcode 26 beta 5, and might need slight tweaks to run under Xcode 16.

For a much better explanation of the stuff we covered at the meetup, check out the Apple WWDC 2023 video "Explore materials in Reality Composer Pro" available at:
